Here are two additional log graph aliases that will help you understand the state of your local repository.\nlg1\nThis log graph command shows you your commit graph with the hash, date, and author, as well as all branches.\nalias lg1=\"git log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)' --all\"\n\nlg2\nThis log graph command does the same as the above log command, but separates the commit message and author by putting them on their own line.\nalias lg2=\"git log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --format=format:'%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold cyan)%aD%C(reset) %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)%n''          %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)' --all\"\n\n\nTips & Tricks\nFeel free to open a PR with suggestions for tips!\nChange the author of the last commit\nRun: git commit --amend --reset-author\nThis will bring up a vim session and allow you to change the commit text if you want. When you're ready, quit vim (:wq) and force push your branch.\nShow only the files changed\nRun: git status -s\nThis will show you a list of the files changed. (Hint: alias to gss)\nDisplay / Edit Current Author\nTo display the currently configured author / email: git config user.name or git config user.email\nTo set the current author / email, add the name you want to set in quotes after the above, like git config user.name \"Test User\".\n"},"tips/bash.html":{"url":"tips/bash.html","title":"Bash","keywords":"","body":"Bash Tips & Tricks\nLearn Bash via The Bash Academy\nCheck if a file exists\nIf you want to check if a file does not exist, insert a ! in front of the -f.\nif [ -f $PATH_TO_FILE ]; then\n    echo \"File exists!\"\nfi\n\nPassing more than 9 arguments to a script\nIf you're passing more than 9 arguments, then you might want to reconsider what your script is actually doing.\nBut, if not...\nwhile [ $# -ge 1 ]; do\n    case $1 in\n        -a|--argA)  LOCAL_VAR_A=\"$2\"; shift ;;          # DESCRIPTION OF VAR A\n        -b|--argB)  LOCAL_VAR_B=\"$2\"; shift ;;          # DESCRIPTION OF VAR B\n        -*)         echo Unknown option\\: $1 >&2; ;;    #\n    esac\n    shift\ndone\n\nSome thoughts about this approach:\n\nYou should decide what happens when you have an unknown parameter. Your two options are to ignore the parameter or exit immediately. My approach has been to exit immediately.\nYou should check the number of parameters coming into the script before this while statement. If it is one or less, output a list of the possible arguments to your script to help the end user.

This is especially painful when preparing CI machines.\nStarting a Simulator\nBelow are two commands that help make listing and starting simulators a breeze.\nFirst, run xcrun simctl list from the terminal. This command produces the following:\nmbpro:~ user$ xcrun simctl list\n== Device Types ==\niPhone 4s (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-4s)\n...\niPad Pro (12.9-inch) (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPad-Pro)\n...\nApple Watch Series 2 - 38mm (com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.Apple-Watch-Series-2-38mm)\n...\n== Runtimes ==\niOS 11.3 (11.3 - 15E217) - com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-11-3\niOS 11.4 (11.4 - 15F79) - com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-11-4\n...\n== Devices ==\n-- iOS 11.3 --\n    iPhone 5s (7744E450-C895-439B-9CF5-C42CF5D8457C) (Shutdown)\n    iPhone 6 (05B56AC1-BD88-4FAC-ADE3-F2043809602A) (Shutdown)\n    iPhone 6 Plus (4BA7C5B3-56D7-4723-8376-0D2DAECCF8F9) (Shutdown)\n...\n\nFind and copy the ID of the type of simulator you want. I chose the iPhone 6, which has a UDID of 05B56AC1-BD88-4FAC-ADE3-F2043809602A.\nNow, run the following command with the UDID you just copied. Simulator is the name of the app you want to start.\nmbpro:~ user$ open -a \"Simulator\" --args -CurrentDeviceUDID 05B56AC1-BD88-4FAC-ADE3-F2043809602A\n\nStopping a Simulator\nUse the following commands to kill all instances of the simulator. This includes killing the Simulator Service (if you're using CI, use this command cautiously. It can be helpful since some CI tools run the simulator headless).\nmbpro:~ user$ killall -9 \"iPhone Simulator\" || true killall -9 \"iOS Simulator\" || true killall -9 \"Simulator\" || true killall -9 \"com.apple.CoreSimulator.CoreSimulatorService\" || true\n\nApp Code vs Xcode\nXcode is great. Until you start using App Code and realize that being a first class citizen is possible! While you can't edit nibs or storyboards through App Code, the rest of your experience developing and refactoring code is greatly enhanced. Especially when you realize you can finally customize your code formatting rules! My current thoughts are that you should use them beside each other, each to their own strength.\n"},"provisioning/mac.html":{"url":"provisioning/mac.html","title":"Mac","keywords":"","body":"Provisioning Your Mac Machine\nThis page holds information about additional software and configuration for a clean OS X build.\nAdditional Software\nApplications:\n\niTerm2\nVisual Studio Code\nGitkraken (if you are licensed for it)\nMicrosoft Remote Desktop (from the App Store)\nAndroid Studio\nXcode\n\nBrew:\n\ntree\n\nGeneral Mac Config\nThe following modification of the default enviroment configuration allows you to navigate your Mac quickly and efficiently.\nFinder\n\nFinder Preferences\nGeneral\nShow Hard Disks, External Disks, CDs (etc), and Connected Servers\nNew Finder Window should open Home directory\n\n\nSidebar\nHide iCloud Drive\nShow Home directory\n\n\nAdvanced\nCheck Show all file extensions\nCheck Keep folders on top when sorting by name\n\n\n\n\nView Options\nCheck Always open in colum view and Browse in column view\nModify Arrange By to Kind\nModify Sort By to Name\n\n\nAlways Show Hidden Files\n  Run in Terminal: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES\n\n\nConfig: Terminal\n\nChange Terminal shell to zsh: sudo chsh -s $(which zsh)\nFavorite theme: ?\nDefault Window Size: 160 x 40\n\nConfig: ZSH & iTerm2\n\nInstall oh-my-zsh for managing themes and plugins\n  ~/> curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh\n  This command will create the ~/.oh-my-zsh directory with all the necessary contents\n\nImport Agnoster theme to ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/ if it does not already exist\n\nDownload Powerline Fonts, following the instructions from the readme for installation\nChange the following iTerm2 Preferences:\nAppearance:\nTab Bar Location: bottom\nTheme: Dark\n\n\nProfiles:\nImport zsh profile if you already have one\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport .zshrc to the home directory\n\n"},"provisioning/windows.html":{"url":"provisioning/windows.html","title":"Windows","keywords":"","body":"Provisioning Your Windows Machine\nThis page holds information about additional software and configuration for a clean Windows build.\n// TODO: Document Choco Config\nAdditional Software\nInstall the following additional software:\nDevelopment:\n\nPostMan\nVSCode or Atom\n\nDevelopment - Git:\n\nGitBash for Windows\nSourceTree\n\nVisual Studio Customization\n\nAdd line numbers to Code Editor window\nTools > Options > Text Editor > All Languages > General > Line Numbers\n\n\nExtension: Favorite Documents by Vlasov Studio\nAdd Split Window to Code Editor Context (Right-Click) Menu\nTools > Customize > Commands > Context Menu > Editor Context Menus | Code Window\nAdd Command > Window > Split\nMove new Menu item to end of Controls list.\n\n\n\n"},"selfImprovement/readme.html":{"url":"selfImprovement/readme.html","title":"Self Improvement","keywords":"","body":"Self Improvement\nThis section contains articles and books to read for self improvement.\n"}}}
